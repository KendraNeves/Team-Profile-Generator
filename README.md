# 10-Team-Profile-Generator

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to dynamically create an HTML page containing the profiles of developer team members from the Node.js command line. The "inquirer" package was used to prompt the user for role-specific information about each team member, and the "filesystem" (fs) module was used to write these inputs to an HTML file. This project was efficiently accomplished using object oriented programming (OOP) and test driven development (TDD) practices. 

## Features
- CLI for speed and ease of use
- Interactive intelligent prompt to add employees
- Full set of unit tests
- Responsive design

## Insights
While completing this project, I gained a better understanding of the usefulness of OOP and the way it can improve clarity of code while also keeping the code DRY-compliant. I also gained experience with TDD and unit tests and their vital role in programming.
